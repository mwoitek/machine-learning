    "$a^{[1]}$ using `np.random.rand()` to randomly get numbers between 0 and 1.\n",

    "$D^{[1]} = [d^{[1](1)} d^{[1](2)} ... d^{[1](m)}] $ of the same dimension as\n",
    "$A^{[1]}$.\n",
    "2. Set each entry of $D^{[1]}$ to be 1 with probability (`keep_prob`), and 0\n",
    "otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Let's say that keep_prob = 0.8, which means that we want to keep about\n",
    "80% of the neurons and drop out about 20% of them.  We want to generate a vector\n",
    "that has 1's and 0's, where about 80% of them are 1 and about 20% are 0.\n",
    "This python statement:\n",

    "- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.\n",
    "- During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep_prob to keep the same\n",
    "expected value for the activations. For example, if keep_prob is 0.5, then we\n",
    "will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5\n",
    "since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5\n",
    "is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected\n",
