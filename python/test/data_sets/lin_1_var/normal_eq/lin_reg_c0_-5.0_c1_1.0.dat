LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_-5.0_c1_1.0.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 4.99750
theta_1:                                 + 0.99960
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 4.99750 + 0.99960 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 4.99750
theta_1:                                 + 0.99960
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 4.99750 + 0.99960 * x_1
