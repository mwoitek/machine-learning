LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_-2.0_c1_-2.0.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 2.00270
theta_1:                                 - 1.99970
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 2.00270 - 1.99970 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 2.00270
theta_1:                                 - 1.99970
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 2.00270 - 1.99970 * x_1
