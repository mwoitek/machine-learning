LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_3.0_c1_-2.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 2.99261
theta_1:                                 - 2.49912
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 2.99261 - 2.49912 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 2.99261
theta_1:                                 - 2.49912
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 2.99261 - 2.49912 * x_1

LINEAR FUNCTION THAT SHOULD DESCRIBE THE DATA SET
COEFFICIENTS OF THE LINEAR FUNCTION
