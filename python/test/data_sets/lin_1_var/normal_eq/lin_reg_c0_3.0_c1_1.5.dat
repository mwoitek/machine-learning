LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_3.0_c1_1.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.00183
theta_1:                                 + 1.49993
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.00183 + 1.49993 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.00183
theta_1:                                 + 1.49993
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.00183 + 1.49993 * x_1
