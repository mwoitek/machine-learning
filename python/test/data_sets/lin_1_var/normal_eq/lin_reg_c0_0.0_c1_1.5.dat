LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_0.0_c1_1.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 0.00252
theta_1:                                 + 1.49957
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 0.00252 + 1.49957 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 0.00252
theta_1:                                 + 1.49957
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 0.00252 + 1.49957 * x_1
