LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_5.0_c1_-2.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 4.99913
theta_1:                                 - 2.49964
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 4.99913 - 2.49964 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 4.99913
theta_1:                                 - 2.49964
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 4.99913 - 2.49964 * x_1
