LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_-2.0_c1_-2.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 1.99952
theta_1:                                 - 2.49985
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 1.99952 - 2.49985 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 1.99952
theta_1:                                 - 2.49985
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 1.99952 - 2.49985 * x_1
