Name of the input data file: c0_6.0_c1_1.0.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 5.99882
theta_1:                                 + 1.00003
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 5.99882 + 1.00003 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 5.99882
theta_1:                                 + 1.00003
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 5.99882 + 1.00003 * x_1
