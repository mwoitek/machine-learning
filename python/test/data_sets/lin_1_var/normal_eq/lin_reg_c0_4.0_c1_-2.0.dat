LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_4.0_c1_-2.0.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.99851
theta_1:                                 - 1.99967
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.99851 - 1.99967 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.99851
theta_1:                                 - 1.99967
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.99851 - 1.99967 * x_1
