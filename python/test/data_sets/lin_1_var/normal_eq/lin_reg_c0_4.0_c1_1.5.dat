Name of the input data file: c0_4.0_c1_1.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.99952
theta_1:                                 + 1.50012
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.99952 + 1.50012 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 + 3.99952
theta_1:                                 + 1.50012
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = + 3.99952 + 1.50012 * x_1
