LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Name of the input data file: c0_-5.0_c1_-2.5.dat

LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS
Method used to compute the coefficients: NORMAL EQUATION

FIRST APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 5.00332
theta_1:                                 - 2.49932
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 5.00332 - 2.49932 * x_1

SECOND APPROACH
theta_0:                                 - 5.00332
theta_1:                                 - 2.49932
EXPRESSION FOR THE LINEAR FUNCTION:      h(x) = - 5.00332 - 2.49932 * x_1
